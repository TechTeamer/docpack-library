## Description

- **Client**: Contains the frontend React application, including all React components, entry points, and the Webpack configuration for bundling the frontend application.

- **Server**: Contains the backend Node.js/Express.js application, including API routes, utility functions for Docker management, and the server's main application file. The `test` directory contains Mocha-Chai tests for the API.

- **Documentation**: Houses the project's documentation, including architecture and user manuals.

Each main directory (`client`, `server`, `documentation`) includes a `package.json` file for managing dependencies specific to that part of the project.
